# Dev Environments
This repository contains a feedback and issue tracker for Docker Dev Environments.

## Getting Docker Environments
Docker Dev Environments are free as part of Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows ([download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)).

## Introduction
Docker Dev Environments make sharing and collaborating on your code easier than ever before. With just one click, you can share your work-in-progress code with your entire team for faster, higher-quality code reviews. That means less time fixing dependencies, and more time writing new code. With your whole team's work near at hand, you’re just one click away from faster code collaboration.

If you find a problem with the software, first browse the existing issues or search from the bar at the top (s to focus) and then, if you don't find your issue, open a new issue.

If you have new feature requests/improvements then please feel free to open a new feature request here, if you have a new idea not related to Dev Environments then please add something to Dockers public roadmap [See the roadmap](http://github.com/docker/roadmap)
