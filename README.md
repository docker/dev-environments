# Dev Environments
This repository contains a feedback and issue tracker for Docker Dev Environments.

## Getting Docker Environments
Docker Dev Environments are free as part of Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows ([download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)).

## Introduction
Docker Dev Environments make sharing and collaborating on your code easier than ever before. With just one click, you can share your work-in-progress code with your entire team for faster, higher-quality code reviews. That means less time fixing dependencies, and more time writing new code. With your whole team's work near at hand, youâ€™re just one click away from faster code collaboration.

If you find a problem with the software, first browse the existing issues or search from the bar at the top (s to focus) and then, if you don't find your issue, open a new issue.

If you have new feature requests/improvements then please feel free to open a new feature request here, if you have a new idea not related to Dev Environments then please add something to Dockers public roadmap [See the roadmap](http://github.com/docker/roadmap)
